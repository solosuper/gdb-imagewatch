# GDB ImageWatch: The advanced Image Debugger
GDB ImageWatch is a tool for visualizing in-memory buffers during debug
sessions using GDB. It works out of the box with instances of the OpenCV `Mat`
class, but can also be customized to work with any arbitrary data structure.

## Features

* GUI interactivity:
    * Scroll to zoom, left click+drag to move the buffer around;
    * Rotate buffers 90&deg; clockwise or counterclockwise;
    * Go-to widget that quickly takes you to any arbitrary pixel location;
* Buffer values: Zoom in close enough to see the numerical values of the
  buffer.
* Auto update: Whenever a breakpoint is hit, the buffer view is automatically
  updated.
* Auto contrast: The entire range of values present in the buffer can be
  automatically mapped to the visualization range `[0, 1]`, where `0`
  represents black and `1` represents white.
* The contrast range can be manually adjusted, which is useful for inspecting
  buffers with extreme values (e.g. infinity, nan and other outliers).
* Link views together, moving all watched buffers simultaneously when any
  single buffer is moved on the screen
* Supported buffer types: uint8_t, int16_t, uint16_t, int32_t, uint32_t,
  float and double
* Supported buffer channels: Up to four channels (Grayscale, two-channels, RGB
  and RGBA)
* GPU accelerated
* Supports large buffers whose dimensions exceed GL_MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE.
* Supports data structures that map to a ROI of a larger buffer.
* Exports buffers as png images (with auto contrast) or octave/matlab matrix
  files (unprocessed).
* Auto-load buffers being visualized in the previous debug session
* Designed to scale well for HighDPI displays

## Requirements

 * An OpenGL 2.1+ compliant GPU
 * A C++11 compliant compiler (gcc-5 or later is recommended)
 * GDB 7.10+ **compiled with python 3 support**
 * Qt 5.6+ (required due to the HighDPI display support - download it
   [here](https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development))
 * Python 3+ with its development packages

## Installation

### Dependencies

On Ubuntu, you can install most of the dependencies with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install libpython3-dev python3-dev
    sudo apt-get install qt5-default


#### Check GDB version
Before installing the gdb-imagewatch plugin, you need to first check if your
GDB version is >= 7.10:

```shell
gdb --version
```

On Ubuntu 16.04.3, this will print `GNU gdb (Ubuntu 7.11.1-0ubuntu1~16.5)
7.11.1`, which is good enough.

You also need to make sure that your GDB was compiled with Python 3 support.
For that, run the `gdb` command, and inside the gdb console, run the following
command:

```gdb
(gdb) python import sys; print(sys.version)
```

On Ubuntu 16.04.3, this will print `3.5.2 (default, Nov 23 2017, 16:37:01)`,
which meets the requirements.


#### GDB 7.10+ with Python 3
If your GDB version is not supported, you need to download and install a
compatible version of GDB with python3 support. Here are the commands for GDB
7.10:

```shell
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.10.tar.gz
tar -zxvf gdb-7.10.tar.gz
cd gdb-7.10
./configure --with-python=python3 --disable-werror
make -j8
```

Notice that if you already have an older version of GDB, you will need to
either reconfigure your environment running `update-alternatives` or
reconfigure your IDE to use the updated version (which, by default, will be
installed on `/usr/local/bin/gdb`).

After the installation, you can remove both the file `gdb-7.10.tar.gz` and the
folder `gdb-7.10`.

#### Downloading GDB ImageWatch
Clone the GDB ImageWatch plugin to any folder you prefer and initialize the
submodules:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/csantosbh/gdb-imagewatch
cd gdb-imagewatch
git submodule update --init
```

### Ubuntu 16.04 manual installation with QtCreator

Ubuntu 16.04 comes with qt4, which is not compatible with GDB ImageWatch. In
order to compile it, you need to install qt5
([get it here](https://info.qt.io/download-qt-for-application-development)) and
use its corresponding qmake during the compilation step.

If you are using QtCreator, you can change your Qt version under
Tools->Options->Build & Run->Kits, by setting Qt version to any Qt version >=
5.

### Build plugin and configure GDB

To build this plugin, create a `build` folder, open a terminal window inside it
and run:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
export QT_SELECT=5
qmake .. BUILD_MODE=release PREFIX=/path/to/installation/folder
make -j4
make install
```

The installation step is optional; you can simply use the plugin from the build
folder instead. If you choose to install the plugin, it will be placed under
`/path/to/installation/folder/bin/gdb-imagewatch/`.

By default, the `PREFIX` variable is `/usr/local`.


### libGL troubleshooting
Some users might experience a linking error if the libGL.so is not found by
qmake, especially when using a nvidia graphics card. This issue will usually
present itself with the message `cannot find -lGL`.

To fix that, you need to find the location for your libGL.so file. The
following commands should help you find it:

```shell
sudo updatedb
locate -i libgl.so
```

If you have installed the proprietary drivers, you don't want to use the mesa
folder. For example, running the command above could result in the following
output:

```
/usr/lib/nvidia-384/libGL.so
/usr/lib/nvidia-384/libGL.so.1
/usr/lib/nvidia-384/libGL.so.384.90
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/mesa/libGL.so.1.2.0
/usr/lib32/nvidia-384/libGL.so
/usr/lib32/nvidia-384/libGL.so.1
/usr/lib32/nvidia-384/libGL.so.384.90
```

In this case, since I'm using the proprietary nvidia drivers, I'll choose the
folder `/usr/lib/nvidia-384`.

Copy the name of the folder you found, and paste it in the file
`gdb-imagewatch.pro` under the definition of the `QMAKE_LFLAGS` variable. In my
case, this variable now looks like this:

```
QMAKE_LFLAGS += \
  # If you have an error "cannot find -lGL", uncomment the following line and
  # replace the folder by the location of your libGL.so
  -L/usr/lib/nvidia-384/ \
  -Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL
```

Now, just run the build steps again, including the `qmake` command, as
described above.

#### Loading pugin

In order to load the GDB-ImageWatch plugin, simply edit the `~/.gdbinit` file
(create it if it doesn't exist) and append the following line:

    source /path/to/gdb-imagewatch/gdb-imagewatch.py

This way, GDB will automatically load the GDB imagewatch plugin every time it
starts.

### Ubuntu 16.04 Automated Installation without QtCreator

The script `configure_ubuntu_16.sh` automates some of the installation steps
for GDB ImageWatch on Ubuntu 16.04.  From the root directory of this project,
    execute the following:

    bash configure_ubuntu_16.sh

Note that this script will not instal Qt 5.6+ and GDB with python 3 support. If
you don't have these packages, please follow the instructions above.

When you are done, follow the instructions below in the section `Testing your
installation`.

## Testing your installation

After compiling the plugin, you can test it by opening a console in the
installation folder and running the following command from the root project
directory:

    python3 /path/to/gdb-imagewatch/gdb-imagewatch.py --test

If the installation was succesful, you should see the GDB ImageWatch window
with the same `sample_buffer_1` and `sample_buffer_2` buffers from the image on
the header of this page.

## Using plugin

When GDB hits a breakpoint, the GDB ImageWatch window will be opened. You only
need to type the name of the buffer to be watched in the "add symbols" input,
and press `<enter>`.

Alternatively, you can also invoke the GDB ImageWatch window directly from GDB
with the following command:

    plot variable_name

### <img src="doc/auto-contrast.svg" width="20"/> Auto-contrast and manual contrast

The (min) and (max) fields on top of the buffer view can be changed to control
autocontrast settings. By default, GDB ImageWatch will automatically fill these
fields with the mininum and maximum values inside the entire buffer, and the
channel values will be normalized from these values to the range [0, 1] inside
the renderer.

Sometimes, your buffer may contain trash, uninitialized values that are either
too large or too small, making the entire image look flat because of this
normalization. If you know the expected range for your image, you can manually
change the (min) and (max) values to focus on the range that you are
interested.

### <img src="doc/link-views.svg" width="20"/> Locking buffers

Sometimes you want to compare two buffers being visualized, and need to zoom in
different places of these buffers. If they are large enough, this can become a
very hard task, especially if you are comparing pixel values. This task is made
easier by the `lock buffers` tool (which is toggled by the button with a chain
icon).

When it is activated, all buffers are moved/zoomed simultaneously by the same
amount. This means you only need to align the buffers being compared once;
after activating the `lock buffers` mode, you can zoom in anywhere you wish in
one buffer that all other buffers will be zoomed in the same location.

### <img src="doc/location.svg" width="20"/> Quickly moving to arbitrary coordinates

If you need to quickly move to any pixel location, then the *go to*
functionality is what you are looking for. Press *Ctrl+L* and two input fields
corresponding to the target destination in format `<x, y>` will appear at the
bottom right corner of the buffer screen. Type the desired location, then press
enter to quickly zoom into that location.

### Exporting bufers

Sometimes you may want to export your buffers to be able to process them in an
external tool. In order to do that, right click the thumbnail corresponding to
the buffer you wish to export on the left pane and select "export buffer".

GDB ImageWatch supports two export modes. You can save your buffer as a PNG
(which may result in loss of data if your buffer type is not `uint8_t`) or as a
binary file that can be opened with any tool.

### Loading exported buffers on Octave/Matlab

Buffers exported in the `Octave matrix` format can be loaded with the function
`giw_load.m`, which is available in the `matlab` folder. To use it, add this
folder to Octave/Matlab `path` variable and call
`giw_load('/path/to/buffer.dump')`.

### Configure your IDE to use GDB 7.10

If you're not using gdb from the command line, make sure that your IDE is
correctly configured to use GDB 7.10. On QtCreator, go to
`Tools`->`Options`->`Build & Run`->`Debuggers` and make sure that the
configured path references a compatible GDB version.

## Basic configuration

The settings file for the plugin can be located under
`$HOME/.config/gdbimagewatch.ini`. You can change the following settings:

 * **Rendering**
    * *maximum_framerate* Determines the maximum framerate for the buffer
    rendering backend. Must be greater than 0.

## Advanced configuration

By default, the plugin works with several data types, including OpenCV's `Mat`
and `CvMat` and Eigen's `Matrix`.

If you use a different buffer type, you can create a python parser inside the
folder `resources/giwscripts/giwtypes`. This is actually pretty simple and only
involves implementing a class with the methods `get_buffer_metadata()` and
`is_symbol_observable()`.

The function `get_buffer_metadata()` must return a dictionary with the following
fields:

 * **display_name** Name of the buffer as it must appear in the ImageWatch
   window. Can be customized to also show its typename, for instance.
 * **pointer** Pointer to the buffer
 * **width**  Width of the ROI
 * **height** Height of the ROI
 * **channels** Number of color channels (Must be in the range `1 <= channels
   <= 3`)
 * **type** Identifier for the type of the underlying buffer. The supported
   values, defined under `resources/giwscripts/symbols.py`, are:
   * `GIW_TYPES_UINT8` = 0
   * `GIW_TYPES_UINT16` = 2
   * `GIW_TYPES_INT16` = 3
   * `GIW_TYPES_INT32` = 4
   * `GIW_TYPES_FLOAT32` = 5
   * `GIW_TYPES_FLOAT64` = 6

 * **row_stride** Number of pixels you have to skip in order to reach the pixel
   right below any arbitrary pixel. In other words, this can be thought of as
   the width, in pixels, of the underlying containing buffer. If the ROI is the
   total buffer size, this is the same of the buffer width.
 * **pixel_layout** String describing how internal channels should be ordered
   for display purposes. The default value for buffers of 3 and 4 channels is
   `'bgra'`, and `'rgba'` for images of 1 and 2 channels. This string must
   contain exactly four characters, and each one must be one of `'r'`, `'g'`,
   `'b'` or `'a'`.  Repeated channels, such as 'rrgg' are also valid.
 * **transpose_buffer** Boolean indicating whether or not to transpose the
   buffer in the interface. Can be very useful if your data structure represents
   transposition with an internal metadata.

The function `is_symbol_observable()` receives a gdb symbol and a string
containing the variable name, and must only return `True` if that symbol is of
the observable type (the buffer you are dealing with).

It is possible to debug your custom inspector methods by using the python
decorators `@interface.debug_buffer_metadata` and
`@interface.debug_symbol_observable` in the methods `get_buffer_metadata` and
`is_symbol_observable`, respectively. This will print information about all
analyzed symbols in the debugger console every time a breakpoint is hit.
